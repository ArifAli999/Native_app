React native notes application


- One of my first native mobile applications, The purpose of this project was to simply get familiar and undestand the building concepts of mobile development
  and RN after spending several years developing modern highly interactive interfaces for the web.

- This application has fullstack features. It is powered by Expo and React Native. Expo was used due to the extensive library and API provided which makes 
  the developmennt experience extremely pleasant and is like a kickstart to the project. The team at Expo has really come up with something extremely special.
  
  
- The application uses Firebase for the backend of the application, I'm extremely proficinet at using Firebase and have used every feature it has to provide
  extensively over the years so I used the Auth, Storage and Firestore for my database purposes.
  
- The applications interface was designed and developed by me using nothing but pure TailWindCSS. I was amazed at how quickly I was able to craft high quality
  user interfaces with little to no complexity or issues (KeyBoardAvoidingView was a bit annoying to tackle ngl)
  
- The application also has a few superpowers, While Firestore does provide real time features, this could be done way more efficienty by using a fun little library
    known as 'React Query', It was used extensively throughout the application for the data fetching, mutation, invalidating old data and so much more, In short RQ replaced all my useEffects.
